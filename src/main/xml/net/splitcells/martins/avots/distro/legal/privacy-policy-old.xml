				Personal data (usually referred to just as
				<quote>data</quote>
				below)
				will only be processed by us to the extent necessary and for
				the
				purpose of providing a functional and user-friendly website,
				including its contents, and the services offered there.
			</paragraph>
			<paragraph>
				Per Art. 4 No. 1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, i.e. the
				General Data
				Protection Regulation (hereinafter referred to as the
				<quote>GDPR</quote>
				), "processing" refers to any operation or set of operations
				such as
				collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage,
				adaptation, alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by
				transmission, dissemination, or otherwise making available,
				alignment, or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction
				performed on personal data, whether by automated means or not.
			</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The following privacy policy is intended to inform you in
				particular about the type, scope, purpose, duration, and legal basis
				for the processing of such data either under our own control or in
				conjunction with others. We also inform you below about the
				third-party components we use to optimize our website and improve
				the user experience which may result in said third parties also
				processing data they collect and control.
			</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our privacy policy is structured as follows:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>I. Information about us as controllers of your data
			</paragraph>
			<paragraph>II. The rights of users and data subjects</paragraph>

						detail below, users and data subjects have the right:
					</name>
					<tree>
						<name>to confirmation of whether data concerning them is being
							processed, information about the data being processed, further
							information about the nature of the data processing, and copies
							of the data (cf. also Art. 15 GDPR);
						</name>
					</tree>
					<tree>
						<name>to correct or complete incorrect or incomplete data (cf.
							also Art. 16 GDPR);
						</name>
					</tree>
					<tree>
						<name>to the immediate deletion of data concerning them (cf. also
							Art. 17 DSGVO), or, alternatively, if further processing is
							necessary as stipulated in Art. 17 Para. 3 GDPR, to restrict said
							processing per Art. 18 GDPR;
						</name>
					</tree>
					<tree>
						<name>to receive copies of the data concerning them and/or
							provided by them and to have the same transmitted to other
							providers/controllers (cf. also Art. 20 GDPR);
						</name>
					</tree>

				<paragraph>In addition, the controller is obliged to inform all
					recipients to whom it discloses data of any such corrections,
					deletions, or restrictions placed on processing the same per Art.
					16, 17 Para. 1, 18 GDPR. However, this obligation does not apply if
					such notification is impossible or involves a disproportionate
					effort. Nevertheless, users have a right to information about these
					recipients.
				</paragraph>
				<paragraph>
					<strong>Likewise, under Art. 21 GDPR, users and data subjects have
						the right to object to the controller's future processing of their
						data pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. In particular, an
						objection to data processing for the purpose of direct advertising
						is permissible.
					</strong>
				</paragraph>
			</chapter>
			<chapter>
				<title>III. Information about the data processing</title>
				<paragraph>Your data processed when using our website will be

				<chapter>
					<title>Server data</title>
					<paragraph>For technical reasons, the following data sent by your

						not in association with any other of your data.

						GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in the improvement, stability,
						functionality, and security of our website.
					</paragraph>
					<paragraph>The data will be deleted within no more than seven days,
						unless continued storage is required for evidentiary purposes. In
						which case, all or part of the data will be excluded from deletion
						until the investigation of the relevant incident is finally
						resolved.
